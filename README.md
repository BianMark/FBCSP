# FBCSP Toolbox

## Statement
The main code of this project is based on <a href="https://fbcsptoolbox.github.io">FBCSP_Toolbox</a>. 

## Improvement

- More classifier have been added to choose, including **NBPW** and **k-NN**.

- Improve the structure of the project as to easily **manipulate the details** of the whole process of the classification in the main function, e.g., choose different classifier or feature selection method, change the parameters of the feature selection method and the hyperparameter of the classifier.

- **Concrete descriptions** have been added to most of the important functions for users to better understand the codes.

- The **standardization** of the code has been improved.

## Prospect

- May add some neural network methods for classification.

- May add more feature selection methods, e.g., MIRSR.
